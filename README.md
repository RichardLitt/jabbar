## Background

> If a package maintainer uploads an open source package to a package manager, and no one sees it, does it make a sound?

Successful open source projects depend on their community for funding, interest, and long-term growth. Maintainers generally have to do a lot of leg-work themselves to make the package interesting, to attract more users, and to fund their own work. On GitHub, one way of tracking interest is to look at the contributors who have contributed code; or those who have opened issues; or those who have watched a repo; or, last, those who have starred a repository. There is some amount of information on GitHub in user profiles about interested users are and where they came from. Knowing that someone who starred your repo works for a company that may be able to sponsor continued work can be helpful for the maintainer.

This tool started as a simple idea: rather than manually looking through the people who star and watch repositories on GitHub, could we automatically get their affiliations?

*Jabbar* comes from *al jabbar*, meaning 'the giant' the medieval Arabic word for the constellation [Orion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orion_(constellation)). Look to the stars, eh? Any chance relation to the Gom Jabbar is purely not coincidental. (If you can think of a better name, [open an issue](https://github.com/RichardLitt/jabbar/issues/new).)

## Install

This package is on npm:

```sh
npm install jabbar
```

## Usage

### Quickstart

1. Get a [GitHub Token](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line/). Click on 'read:org' in the Scopes page.
2. `npm install --global jabbar`
3. `GITHUB_TOKEN=asdsafs jabbar RichardLitt/jabbar`

### Authentication

This module looks for an auth token in the environmental variable `GITHUB_TOKEN`. It needs to have the `read:org` scope in order to function properly. Make sure this var is set to a valid GitHub OAuth token. To create one see [this article](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line/).

### CLI

```
$ jabbar --help

  Usage
    $ jabbar <input> [--watchers|--stargazers]

  Options
    -r, --repo    - Repository to search. Format: RichardLitt/jabbar
                    This flag is used as the default input.
    --all         - The default: get all watchers, stargazers, and forkers
    -w, --watchers    - Get watchers for a repository
    -s, --stargazers  - Get stargazers for a repository
    -f, --forkers     - Get forkers for a repository
    --ignored     - Ignore a user. Defaults to include owner of repository.
                    Use csv for multiple users.
    -h, --help        - Show this printout
    --output <file>   - Print the results to a file as JSON

  Authentication
    This script looks for an auth token in the env var GITHUB_TOKEN. It needs
    to have the read:org scope in order to function properly. Make sure this
    var is set to a valid GitHub OAuth token.

  Examples
    $ jabbar RichardLitt/jabbar
    $ jabbar --repo RichardLitt/jabbar --watchers
    $ jabbar RichardLitt/jabbar -w --output=results.json

    # To pass an authentication token
    $ GITHUB_TOKEN=sd2991s jabbar -r RichardLitt/jabbar -w
```

### Programmatic

```js
const j = require('jabbar')

// The main functions return a Promise, so wrap it in an async function
(async () => {
  let response = await j.getWatchers('RichardLitt', 'jabbar')
})()
```

Don't forget to set the `GITHUB_TOKEN` somewhere in your env.

### Testing

This module uses Mocha. To run the tests, run: `npm run test`.
